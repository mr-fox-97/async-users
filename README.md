**User Management Domain Model**

A Python-based domain model for user management, featuring a robust and scalable architecture. This project provides a foundation for building user-centric applications, with a focus on simplicity, flexibility, and testability.

**Key Features**

* **Flexible User Registration**: Register users with a variety of authentication methods, not limited to traditional username and password combinations. Easily extend the system to support new authentication methods as needed.
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on an event-driven architecture, allowing for loose coupling between components and enabling a more scalable and resilient system. This architecture enables easy extension of the system through the addition of new event handlers, which can react to specific events and perform custom logic.
* **Microservices-Ready**: Designed with microservices in mind, making it easy to integrate with other services and systems. The event-driven architecture and decoupled repositories and adapters enable seamless communication between microservices.
* **Decoupled Repositories and Adapters**: Interact with various data storage systems, such as databases and file systems, using decoupled repositories and adapters. This allows for easy switching between different storage systems or adding new ones as needed.
* **UnitOfWork Pattern**: Implementing the UnitOfWork pattern to manage transactions and ensure data consistency.
* **Application Services**: A set of application services for performing common user management operations, such as user creation, authentication, and password verification.
* **Test-Driven Development**: A comprehensive test suite using Pytest, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the domain model.
* **Extensibility through Event and Command Handlers**: Easily extend the system by adding new event handlers, which can react to specific events and perform custom logic. Command handlers can also be added to handle specific commands, such as user registration or password reset. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility, making it easy to adapt the system to specific business needs.

With this architecture, you can easily add new features or functionality by:

* Creating new event handlers to react to specific events, such as user registration or password reset.
* Implementing new command handlers to handle specific commands, such as user creation or authentication.
* Adding new adapters to interact with different data storage systems or services.
* Extending the application services to perform new user management operations.

This flexibility and extensibility make it easy to adapt the system to specific business needs and ensure that it remains scalable and maintainable over time.


**Getting Started**

To run the tests, execute the following commands, be sure to have docker installed in your system:

1. `docker-compose --profile tests up --build --exit-code-from python-tests`
2. `docker compose down -v --remove-orphans`

This will spin up a Docker container with the necessary dependencies, run the tests, and then tear down the container.
